For learning purposes only.

Each exp.py contains detailed comments, which may greatly help you.

Environment and tools: Ubuntu64, gcc, gdb-peda, pwntools, ROPgadget, one_gadget, patchelf
* StackOverflow includes ret2shellcode, ret2text, ret2libc, rop, ret2syscall, ret2csu.
* FormatString is really tough(if you write the 2nd payload yourself, instead of using 'fmtstr_payload()'), so be prepared.
* Please note that there is a bug in the original exp.py, so download 'FormatString_updated.zip' for use.
* HeapOverflow is more challenging, which will not be shown here.
